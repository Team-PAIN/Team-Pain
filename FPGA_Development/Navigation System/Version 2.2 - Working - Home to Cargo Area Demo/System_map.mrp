    Number used as AND/OR logics:                0
  Number of Slice LUTs:                        921 out of   9,112   10%
    Number used as logic:                      910 out of   9,112    9%
      Number using O6 output only:             451
      Number using O5 output only:             132
      Number using O5 and O6:                  327
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   2,176    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:     11
      Number with same-slice register load:      0
      Number with same-slice carry load:        11
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Nummber of MUXCYs used:                      612 out of   4,556   13%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        1,029
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           616 out of   1,029   59%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 108 out of   1,029   10%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         305 out of   1,029   29%
    Number of unique control sets:              35
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             136 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
